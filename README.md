##Therapize

Our project is built to address prompt category 6: health 
and sustainable development goal #3: Good Health and Well-Being. 
_Therapize_ connects people seeking mental health with 
volunteer professionals, aiming to increase access to mental health 
services, which the University of Cypress found in a 2020 study is 
positively correlated with improvements in quality of life, morbidity, mortality, 
and life expectancy. Patients can choose therapists based 
on their rating (generated by asking for reviews after sessions 
and performing a sentiment analysis of those reviews with 
a Hugging Face BERT API), personality type, and time available to chat. 
The chat interface, built with daily.co, also helps therapists
perform their jobs by performing a mood analysis using the DeepFace library
on patients' faces and updating the therapists on the predicted feelings
of patients on a minutely basis. We use Firebase to store data about professionals
who are available at given times.
